## 📅 Day 35 – Java 8 Features & Lambda Expressions  
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Introduced **Java 8 features** and how they simplify code while improving readability and performance.
- Learned **Lambda Expressions** to write concise implementations of functional interfaces.
- Explored **Functional Interfaces** such as `Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Supplier`.
- Used **Java Streams API** for declarative data processing: filtering, mapping, sorting, and aggregation.
- Applied **method references** (`Class::method`) as a cleaner alternative to lambdas where applicable.
- Understood **default and static methods in interfaces** and their role in backward compatibility.
- Practiced **Optional** to avoid `NullPointerException` and write safer null-handling logic.
- Explored **forEach, map, filter, reduce, collect** operations on collections.
- Compared **imperative vs functional programming** styles using real examples.
