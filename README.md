## 📅 Day 40 – Design Principles & Design Patterns in Java
**(Date: 01-Feb-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- **Design Principles (SOLID)**  
  Studied **Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion** to build maintainable, scalable, and testable applications.

- **Other Core Principles**  
  Explored **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**, **KISS (Keep It Simple)**, and **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)** to reduce complexity and avoid over-engineering.

- **Creational Design Patterns**  
  Learned patterns like **Singleton**, **Factory Method**, and **Builder** for controlled object creation and flexibility in system design.

- **Structural Design Patterns**  
  Understood **Adapter**, **Decorator**, and **Facade** patterns to simplify interfaces, extend behavior, and integrate incompatible components.

- **Behavioral Design Patterns**  
  Covered **Strategy**, **Observer**, and **Command** patterns to handle communication, algorithms, and event-driven behavior efficiently.

## 📅 Day 41 – Multithreading & Concurrency in Java  
**(Date: 02-Feb-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Understood the **need for multithreading** and how it improves performance and responsiveness in CPU-intensive and I/O-bound applications.
- Learned different ways to **create threads**: extending `Thread`, implementing `Runnable`, and using `Callable` with `Future`.
- Explored **thread lifecycle states**: New, Runnable, Running, Waiting/Blocked, and Terminated.
- Studied **synchronization** to handle shared resources and avoid race conditions using `synchronized` methods and blocks.
- Understood **inter-thread communication** using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`.
- Learned common **concurrency problems** such as deadlock, starvation, and livelock.
- Introduced **Executor Framework** (`ExecutorService`, thread pools) for efficient thread management.
- Explored **thread-safe collections** and basic concepts of `volatile` and atomic operations.
- Compared **single-threaded vs multi-threaded** execution with real-world examples (banking, ticket booking, logging systems).
