**(Date: 25-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Learned **CSV fundamentals** and its role in storing tabular data for real-world systems like HR, finance, and analytics.
- Implemented **CSV reading using Core Java** (`BufferedReader`) with manual parsing and understood its limitations.
- Explored **OpenCSV library** for robust CSV handling, including support for quoted values, custom delimiters, and cleaner APIs.
- Practiced **writing CSV files** using both Core Java (`BufferedWriter`) and OpenCSV (`CSVWriter`) with proper formatting.
- Converted CSV data into **Java objects (POJOs)** using `CsvToBean` for structured data processing.
- Implemented **CSV data validation** using regex and conditional checks for numeric fields and missing values.
- Understood **real-world use cases** such as employee record processing, bulk data import/export, and pre-database validation.

## 📅 Day 34 – JSON Data Handling & Operations in Java
**(Date: 26-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Learned **JSON fundamentals** as a lightweight, text-based format for structured data exchange in APIs, configuration files, and persistence.  
- Implemented **JSON parsing** in Java using multiple approaches: Core library (`org.json`), **Gson**, and **Jackson** for flexible and robust handling.  
- Practiced **creating, updating, and deleting JSON objects** and arrays, including handling **nested structures**.  
- Performed **JSON file operations**, including reading from and writing to files while managing exceptions effectively.  
- Converted JSON data to **Java POJOs** using **Gson** and **Jackson ObjectMapper** for object mapping and structured processing.  
- Implemented **validation checks** on JSON content, ensuring required keys exist, correct data types, and handling null or missing values.  
- Explored **real-world use cases** such as API response handling, data persistence, configuration management, and dynamic updates to JSON content.
