## Data Structures

### 📅 Day 16 – Data Structures Overview & Linked Lists  
**(Date: 03-Jan-2026)**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- Understood the **fundamentals of Data Structures**:
  - Learned how data structures organize and store data efficiently.
  - Studied common examples such as Linked Lists.

- Explored **Key Features of Data Structures in Java**:
  - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
    - Learned how structures like Lists and Maps grow and shrink dynamically.
  - **Generics Support**:
    - Ensured type safety and reduced runtime errors.
 
- Studied **Types of Data Structures in Java**:
  - **Linear Data Structures**:
    - Array (fixed-size, contiguous memory).
    - Linked List (dynamic node-based structure).
    - Circular Linked list.
    - Linear Linked List.
    - Doubly Linked List.

### 📅 Day 17 – Stack, Queue & Hashing Fundamentals  
**(Date: 04-Jan-2026)**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- Studied **Stack Data Structure (LIFO)**:
  - Understood core operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`.
  - Explored real-world use cases:
    - Function call stack in recursion.
    - Undo/Redo operations.
    - Expression evaluation and parenthesis matching.

- Learned **Queue Data Structure (FIFO)**:
  - Understood key operations: `offer`, `poll`, `peek`, `isEmpty`.
  - Explored Java Queue implementations:
    - `LinkedList`
    - `PriorityQueue`
    - `ArrayDeque`
  - Implemented **Ticket Counter Management System**:
    - Enqueued customers as they arrived.
    - Dequeued customers in order of service.
  - Studied queue usage in:
    - Task scheduling.
    - BFS traversal.
    - Request handling systems.

- Explored **HashMap & Hashing Concepts**:
  - Understood key-value pair storage using `HashMap`.
  - Learned core methods: `put`, `get`, `remove`, `containsKey`.
  - Implemented word frequency counting using HashMap.
  - Studied internal working of HashMap:
