### 📅 Day 10 – Java OOPs (Constructors & Access Modifiers) Programs
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

- Studied Constructors in Java (default, parameterized, and copy constructors).
- Learned the difference between instance variables and class variables.
- Practiced access modifiers (public, protected, private) and understood their scope.

### 📅 Day 11 – Java Keywords 

**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- Learned and implemented important Java keywords:
  - `this` – to refer to current class instance variables and methods.
  - `static` – to define class-level variables and methods.
  - `final` – to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.

- Understood differences between:
  - this vs static
  - Instance members vs static members
  - Final variables vs non-final variables

- Focused on:
  - Logical flow building
  - Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
  - Looping constructs
  - Clean and readable code structure

- Improved debugging skills and code readability.

### Day 12 – Java Object Modeling

**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

### 📘 Topics Covered
 - Practiced real-world scenario-based problem solving using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
 - Learned how to identify entities, attributes, and relationships from problem statements.
 - Designed and implemented object models before writing code.
 - Understood and applied different types of relationships:
   - Association – objects related but independent
   - Aggregation – “has-a” relationship with independent lifecycles
   - Composition – strong ownership and dependency

 - Key Concepts Applied
    - Breaking real-world problems into:
    - Classes
    - Objects
    - Responsibilities

 - Mapping real-life scenarios into:
    - Class diagrams (conceptual understanding)
    - Logical method responsibilities

### 📅 Day 13 – Inheritance & Types of Inheritance in Java  
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- Learned the concept of **Inheritance** in Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Reusing properties and behaviors of an existing class.
  - Promoting code reusability and logical hierarchy.
  - Understanding the `extends` keyword.

- Explored different **types of inheritance supported in Java**:
  - **Single Inheritance** – One child class inherits from one parent class.
  - **Multilevel Inheritance** – A class derived from another derived class.
  - **Hierarchical Inheritance** – Multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class.
  - **Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces)** – Achieved using interfaces since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes.
  - **Hybrid Inheritance (conceptual)** – Combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance using interfaces.

- Practiced usage of:
  - `super` keyword to access parent class constructors and methods.
  - Method overriding and runtime polymorphism.
  - Accessing inherited members based on access modifiers.

- Implemented real-world examples such as:
  - Person → Waiter → Chef hierarchy
  - Vehicle → Electrical Vehicle
  - Student → Teacher → Staff

### 📅 Day 14 – Encapsulation, Interfaces, Abstract Classes & Polymorphism  
**(Date: 01-Jan-2026)**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- Learned and implemented **Encapsulation**:
  - Used `private` variables to protect data.
  - Applied getters and setters to provide controlled access.

- Understood **Polymorphism** concepts:
  - Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).
  - Method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
  - Achieved flexible and reusable code using dynamic method dispatch.

- Studied **Interfaces**:
  - Used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
  - Enforced method contracts across implementing classes.

- Learned **Abstract Classes**:
  - Used for abstraction by defining abstract and non-abstract methods.
  - Enabled partial implementation and code reuse.

- Implemented practical programs focusing on:
  - Object-oriented design principles.
  - Real-world modeling using OOP concepts.
  - Clean and maintainable code structure.

- Pushed all implementations to the GitHub repository.
