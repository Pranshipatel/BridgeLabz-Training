## 📅 Day 35 – Java 8 Features & Lambda Expressions  
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Introduced **Java 8 features** and how they simplify code while improving readability and performance.
- Learned **Lambda Expressions** to write concise implementations of functional interfaces.
- Explored **Functional Interfaces** such as `Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Supplier`.
- Used **Java Streams API** for declarative data processing: filtering, mapping, sorting, and aggregation.
- Applied **method references** (`Class::method`) as a cleaner alternative to lambdas where applicable.
- Understood **default and static methods in interfaces** and their role in backward compatibility.
- Practiced **Optional** to avoid `NullPointerException` and write safer null-handling logic.
- Explored **forEach, map, filter, reduce, collect** operations on collections.
- Compared **imperative vs functional programming** styles using real examples.

## 📅 Day 36 – Functional Interfaces in Java  
**(Date: 28-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Understood the concept of **Functional Interfaces** and their role in enabling lambda expressions.
- Learned the purpose of the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation and its compile-time safety benefits.
- Explored **built-in functional interfaces** from `java.util.function`:
  - `Predicate<T>` for boolean conditions
  - `Function<T, R>` for data transformation
  - `Consumer<T>` for performing actions
  - `Supplier<T>` for providing values
- Implemented **custom functional interfaces** for domain-specific operations.
- Practiced **lambda expressions vs anonymous classes** and identified when to use each.
- Learned **functional interface composition** using `andThen()`, `compose()`, `and()`, `or()`, and `negate()`.
- Used **method references** as a clean alternative to lambda expressions.
- Combined functional interfaces with **Streams API** for real-world data processing.

## 📅 Day 37 – Streams API in Java 
**(Date: 29-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

Learned the fundamentals of the **Java Streams API** and how it enables functional-style data processing.
- Understood the difference between **Streams vs Collections** and when to use each.
- Explored **stream creation techniques** from collections, arrays, files, and generators.
- Practiced **intermediate operations** such as `filter()`, `map()`, `flatMap()`, `distinct()`, `sorted()`, and `limit()`.
- Implemented **terminal operations** like `forEach()`, `collect()`, `reduce()`, `count()`, `min()`, and `max()`.
- Used **Collectors** (`toList()`, `toSet()`, `toMap()`, `groupingBy()`, `partitioningBy()`, `joining()`).
- Learned **lazy evaluation** and how streams process data only when a terminal operation is invoked.
- Explored **parallel streams**, their performance benefits, and when to avoid them
