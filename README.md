## 📅 Day 20 – Runtime Analysis & Big O Notation  
**(Date: 07-Jan-2026)**


### 📝 Topics Covered

Studied **Big O Notation** to analyze **time and space complexity** and evaluate algorithm performance as input size grows.
### Algorithm Analysis & Big O – Scenario-Based Insights

- Studied **Big O Notation** to evaluate time & space complexity for growing inputs.

**Scenario-Based Learnings**

1. **Searching Large Datasets**
   - Linear Search → O(N)
   - Binary Search → O(log N)  Efficient for large, sorted data

2. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Bubble Sort → O(N²)
   - Merge Sort → O(N log N)
   - Quick Sort → O(N log N) Avoid Bubble Sort for large inputs

3. **String Concatenation**
   - `String` → O(N²)
   - `StringBuilder` / `StringBuffer` → O(N) Mutable strings are faster

4. **Large File Reading**
   - `FileReader` → Slower (character-based)
   - `InputStreamReader` → Faster (byte-based) Efficient stream selection matters

5. **Fibonacci Computation**
   - Recursive → O(2ⁿ)
   - Iterative → O(N) Iterative is faster & memory-efficient

6. **Data Structure Lookups**
   - Array → O(N)
   - HashSet → O(1)
   - TreeSet → O(log N) HashSet offers fastest lookup; TreeSet maintains order
