- Designing clean, maintainable generic APIs.

### Scenario-Based Implementations
1. **Smart Warehouse Management System**
   - Generic storage for different item types using bounded type parameters.
   - Wildcards to display heterogeneous inventory safely.

2. **Dynamic Online Marketplace**
   - Generic product catalog with type-restricted categories.
   - Generic discount application across product types.

3. **University Course Management System**
   - Generic course handling with different evaluation models.
   - Wildcards for dynamic course processing.

4. **Personalized Meal Plan Generator**
   - Generic meal handling with validated meal categories.
   - Type-safe generation using bounded generics.

5. **AI-Driven Resume Screening System**
   - Generic resume processing for multiple job roles.
   - Wildcards for flexible screening pipelines.

## 📅 Day 28 – Java File Handling & Streams
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Learned **core Java I/O concepts** including file reading/writing, buffering, and stream hierarchies.
- Implemented **efficient file operations** using buffered streams, chunk-based reading, and performance comparison with unbuffered streams.
- Practiced **data persistence techniques** such as serialization/deserialization and storing primitive data using data streams.
- Explored **advanced stream usage** including byte array streams for binary files and piped streams for inter-thread communication.
- Solved real-world problems like **large file processing**, word frequency analysis, error log scanning, and user input handling with proper exception management.

## 📅 Day 29 – Exception Handling in Java
**(Date: 20-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Understood **Java exception handling fundamentals** using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`, along with the complete exception hierarchy.
- Differentiated between **checked and unchecked exceptions**, their use cases, and how compile-time vs runtime errors are handled.
- Practiced handling **common runtime exceptions** (NullPointer, Arithmetic, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, etc.) with single, multiple, and nested try-catch blocks.
- Designed and implemented **custom exceptions** for real-world scenarios like banking transactions and user authentication.
- Learned **best practices** including try-with-resources, specific exception handling, meaningful messages, and clean resource management.

## 📅 Day 30 – JUnit Testing & Java Regular Expressions (Regex)
**(Date: 22-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Practiced **JUnit testing fundamentals** including unit tests for calculators, string utilities, list operations, exception handling, parameterized tests, lifecycle annotations (`@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`), timeouts, and file handling.
- Implemented **advanced JUnit scenarios** such as banking transactions, password validation, temperature conversion, date formatting, and user registration with proper exception assertions.
- Learned **Java Regex basics** using `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes for matching, searching, and replacing text.
- Explored **regex metacharacters and quantifiers** to build flexible patterns for digits, words, boundaries, repetitions, and validations.
- Built **real-world regex validations and extractors** including email, password, phone number checks, hashtag extraction, date parsing, domain extraction, and text cleanup using `find()`, `matches()`, and `replaceAll()`.
