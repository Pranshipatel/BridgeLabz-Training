  - this vs static
  - Instance members vs static members
  - Final variables vs non-final variables

- Focused on:
  - Logical flow building
  - Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
  - Looping constructs
  - Clean and readable code structure

- Improved debugging skills and code readability.
