## 📅 Day 26 – Java Generics: Best Practices & Real-World Scenarios
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Type-safe programming using generics (`<T>`, `<E>`, `<K, V>`).
- Generic methods over method overloading.
- Upper (`? extends T`) and lower (`? super T`) bounded wildcards.
- Avoiding raw types and type-erasure pitfalls.
- Designing clean, maintainable generic APIs.

### Scenario-Based Implementations
1. **Smart Warehouse Management System**
   - Generic storage for different item types using bounded type parameters.
   - Wildcards to display heterogeneous inventory safely.

2. **Dynamic Online Marketplace**
   - Generic product catalog with type-restricted categories.
   - Generic discount application across product types.

3. **University Course Management System**
   - Generic course handling with different evaluation models.
   - Wildcards for dynamic course processing.

4. **Personalized Meal Plan Generator**
   - Generic meal handling with validated meal categories.
   - Type-safe generation using bounded generics.

5. **AI-Driven Resume Screening System**
   - Generic resume processing for multiple job roles.
   - Wildcards for flexible screening pipelines.

## 📅 Day 27 – Java Collections Framework
**(Date: 17-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

- Learned the structure and purpose of the **Java Collections Framework** for efficient data handling.
- Studied core collection interfaces: **List, Set, Queue, and Map**.
- Explored common implementations: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap`.
- Understood differences in **ordering, duplication, performance, and use cases**.
- Practiced choosing the right collection based on **time complexity and problem requirements**.
